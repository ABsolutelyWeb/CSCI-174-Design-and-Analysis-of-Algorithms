===== CHAPTER 1 NOTES =====
===== Algorithms Introduction =====

QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:
	
	1. What are algorithms?
	2. Why is the study of algorithms worth our time?
	3. What is the role of algorithms relative to other technologies used in computers?

	
=== 1.1 ===
	
What is an algorithm?

	- Any well-defined computational procedure that takes some values as input and produces
	  some values as output.
	  
	- A sequence of computational steps that transform the input to output. They take some
	  value, perform actions on those values, and output the result.
	  
	- It can also be looked at as a tool for solving well-defined computational problems.
	
	- For example, say we have a sorting algorithm that takes in an unsorted array. Say
	  that array is arr = {31, 41, 59, 26, 41, 58}. The algorithm takes arr as input and
	  then outputs the sorted array as {26, 31, 41, 41, 58, 59}.
	
		- In this case, arr is an instance of a problem. The input can be any array of type
		  int.
		  
	- An algorithm is correct if for every valid input it can produce a valid result or it 
	  can handle errors.
	  

What sorts of problems can algorithms solve?

	- Sorting, Human Genome Project, Internet searches, electronic commerce, manufacturing, etc.
	

Data Structures

	- A way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications.
	
	
=== 1.2 Algorithms as a Technology ===

3 things to keep in mind when designing algorithms:

	1. Space in memory (might be inexpensive, but isn't free)
	2. Computing time (bounded resource)
	

Efficiency
	
	- Different algorithms used for the same problem will likely vary in efficiency. 
	- Let's examine Merge Sort and Insertion Sort. Both are excellent for sorting, but one is
	  better than the other depending on input size. For example, although insertion sort 
	  usually runs faster than merge sort for small input sizes, once the input size n becomes 
	  large enough, merge sortâ€™s advantage of lg n vs. n will be more apparent.

	  
Algorithms and technologies

	- Algorithms are at the core of most technologies used in contemporary computers.
